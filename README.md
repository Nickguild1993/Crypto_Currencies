# Fun Times with Crypto Currencies

### Le Purpose

The purpose of this challenge was to run machine learning analysis on a dataset comprised of various cryptocurrencies that our team wishes to learn more about in terms of their stability, potential ROI, liquidity (lol), and performance.  To do this we wittled down the original list of cryptos to 532 options to analyize using various **transformation** methods, which would then allow us to further delve into the dataset. 

After successfully performing an ardous series of transformations, we were then able to use **clustering** to formulate and utilize **K-means** to find the best k value on the elbow chart.  From here, we were able to make predictions based on the (3) principal components we had devised.

The next step we conducted was to perform **dimensionality reduction** on our data.  To do so, we used *feature elimination, feature extraction* and *principal component analysis*.

From there we ran our plots- both 3-d and 2-d versions that helped us visualize the data of all these hip cryptocurrencies that are *absolutely* currencies and **not** commodities because we shouldn't let concepts like assest liqudity get in the way of things!
